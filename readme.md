## Documentation Tips <br>

To document the work, installed Visual Studio Codec(VSC). Following is the procedure to clone at VSC for displaying at GitHub. <br>

Link to download VSC https://code.visualstudio.com/ <br>

    --Open "New Window" in visual Studio Code
    --Copy the clone Address from Github
    --This is the command to see the clone address at Github "Control + Shift + P"
    --Clone address will pop up.Copy and Paste in Visual Studio Code at "Git: Clone"
    --install Windows GIT. Then automatically GIT Bash also will be installed and open GIT Bash. Enter the below commands in GIT bash.
    --admin@STPH13LP01 MINGW64 ~
    --$ git config --global user.name (enter username)
    --admin@STPH13LP01 MINGW64 ~
    --$ git config --global user.email (enter valid e-mail)
