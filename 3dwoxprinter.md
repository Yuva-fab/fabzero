![Sindoh 3D WOX Printer Image](img/Sindoh_3DWOX_Printer.jpg)<br>
3D printer which we have is a 0.4 mm dia. So Scale the object as per the requirement. If we scale below 0.4 mm dia the object don't print exactly. <br>
Object printing time is depend on size of the object going to print, if size is big it will print hours together.<br>
# Procedure for 3D print <br>
    --Open the 3D_WOX printer software and load the object which was designed in a software OR downloaded from the net.<br>
    --Give the Print, it will calculate the printing duration and will display. 
    --Printer will display the object what is going to print on the screen.
    --Printer nozzle will be heated up to 200 degree C. Then printing will start.
    --After completion of print, properly we have to remove the bed and place it on a table for 2 min. to reduce the heat.
    --With the help of hand knife remove the object from the bed.

# Following is the object printed at FAB LAB. <br>
